# Board-Game_MQTT
Implementation of Board Game using MQTT


- To run first you need to start HiveMq 
    - then run activity.sh file by running following commands
    	- chmod +x activity.sh
    	- ./activity.sh
    	
    - In activity.sh file there is a script where all players running commands are present 
    - if you want to check test cases you need to change activity.sh file accordingly
   
   
   - I have given sample test case in tar file with the code 
   - NOTE : keep all players.txt files in a same directory where players.py and activity.sh files are present.
